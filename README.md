Also included are information about a persona's stats, elementals and skills.

Note: the cost is estimated and is not accurate.

### How fusion in Persona 5 works

In general, fusion in Persona 5 is still mostly the same as in Persona 3 and 4, with a few additional rules:

 - There are rare persona (Regent, Queen's Necklace, Stone of Scone, Koh-i-Noor, Orlov, Emperor's Amulet, Hope Diamond and Crystal Skull) that when fused with a normal persona X will result in another persona either one or two ranks above or below X's current level. Whether to move up or down rank and whether to move one or two steps depending on the rare persona and X's arcana.
 
 - Rare persona cannot be the result of a fusion.
 
 - When doing a fusion, either a normal one, a same-arcana-downrank one or a rare one, if the result is a rare persona, it will be skipped.
 
 - There is no longer 3-way fusion.
 
 - There are DLC persona. If you don't own a DLC persona, it will be skipped during fusion.
 
This calculator assumes that you own all DLC persona by default (you can change which DLC persona you own [here](https://chinhodado.github.io/persona5_calculator/#/setting)). It also assumes that when you do a rare fusion your persona is at the base level, so please keep that in mind if you don't get the same result as shown.

### Note on fusion with Judgement arcana

According to the [official guide](http://atlus.com/persona5/manual/ps4/?pid=50) a fusion between a persona of the Judgement arcana and another persona of the Justice/Strength/Chariot/Death arcana is possible, but this is actually not the case in game.
